    <img src="images/grad.jpg" id="gradPic">
    <p class = "upper aboutText" align="justify">My name is Ryan, I am 20 years old, and I grew up in Bucklands Beach, Auckland. I attended
       Macleans College, where I was a school and sports prefect, often organizing and running events
       held by, and within, the school. I have just completed my Bachelors in Computer and Information
       Science at AUT University, majoring in Software Development.</p>
    <p class="aboutText" align="justify">
       My passion lies in all things
         front-end, especially in the area of UX / UI Design and development. Through my work experience, I
         have encountered the full agile software development lifecycle, and enjoy the challenges it presents
         on a global scale. I am extremely keen to start my web development career, and become an expert in
         technology related to front-end (JS, React, Angular etc). In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar,
         working out, and (to be honest) exploring development.</p>
